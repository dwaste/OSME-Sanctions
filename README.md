## OSME-Sanctions

This repository was designed for the Ongoing Sanctions in the Middle East report. The associated R script and HTML leaflet file are included.

While this repository won't be directly applicable to other projects, it provides a solid framework for understanding how leaflet and R can be used to create geopolitical maps.

The visualization is hosted on my GitHub Pages site.
