## OSME-Sanctions

This repository was designed for Ongoing Sanctions in the Middle East report. The associated R script and HTML leaflet file are included. 

While this repo won't be able to directly applied to other projects, it includes a solid framework for understanding how lealet and R can be used to create geopolitical maps.

The visualization is hosted on my github pages site.
